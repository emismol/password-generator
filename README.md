# Password Generator
### ASK
I want to create a password generator that will take a unique list of requirements for each use and return a unique password. It should allow me to select things like number, caps, and special value when creating a password and it should also allow me to choose the length. The password should be between 8-128 characters.

#### Method 
Ask the user for their password requirements 

Log those requirements and return a unique output that meets the criteria.

Generate a new prompt with each visit to the webpage.
